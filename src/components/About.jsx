        We are dedicated IT students with a
         strong interest in modern software development and cloud technologies. For our final year project (PFE),
          we developed a microservices-based platform to manage technical incidents in gas stations across Tunisia.
           Our system uses React.js for the frontend, Node.js and FastAPI for the backend services, 
           and Firebase for real-time data storage and authentication. The architecture ensures modularity, scalability,
            and efficient communication between services. Through this project, we aimed to solve real operational problems by offering a smart,
             responsive, and user-friendly solution. We worked collaboratively and adapted quickly to new technologies to bring this project to life.
